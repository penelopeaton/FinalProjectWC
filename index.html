        <blockquote>
<p>"These people are signing up and agreeing that they’ll give up their lives if need be,"  said Skeek Frazee, a congressional Office Manager focusing on Veteran outreach,"so…what is the counter obligation of our government to support these people after wards…?" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are approximately 22 million Veterans throughout the United States. The government supports the majority of Veterans through the U.S. Department of Veteran Affair’s health and benefits program. The funds are allocated to 7 various departments within the body: Compensation &amp; Pension, Construction, Education &amp; Vocational Rehabilitation/Employment, Loan Guarantees, General Operating Expenses, Insurance &amp; Indemnities, and Medical Care.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Most people think that if they’ve served [as a Veteran in the army] they therefore qualify for Veteran’s benefits, but in fact, in terms of VA medical care, there are 8-12 categories, and depending on where you are in those categories you may or may not be entitled to healthcare or other services through the VA,"  said Frazee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of the issues that come out of this have to do with qualifying for the program, and the program funding itself—as owed compensation can be costly for the government, according to Frazee. Some service members may forget or have no need for signing up with Veteran Affairs, but when they find themselves in harms way and they no longer qualify for federal assistance, they turn to a person like Frazee for council. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The number of people who get care is based on the federal budget basically,"  said Frazee. "You can imagine what it’s like with the volume of veterans, what that costs our government—But, it’s an appropriate expense just at no small cost." </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In efforts to enhance the VA Veteran program, the VA is working on a <a href="http://www.research.va.gov/currents/0915-2.cfm">study</a>, with several partners, that focuses on the most effective programs and services for Veterans after deployment. The program takes a closer look at the emotional and physical response of transitioning back into society after serving.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"All these IED’s that have caused these injuries that are really life changing—blowing all your limps off, or these terrible head injuries, people come back but they’re never the same,"  Frazee exclaimed. "It’s an extraordinarily expensive system to operate—it’s essentially the costs of a war." </p>
